# 2x-productivity
Boost your productivity by smartly managing your time with 2x Productivity.

This is a multiplatform desktop app used to efficiently utilize your time by prioritizing your tasks. You can set alarms for important tasks. You can add, see, update and delete tasks.


## Technologies used in this project:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Electron JS


## Do I have to learn how to create desktop apps?

I am sure that you might have used many of these desktop apps: **Visual Studio Code**, **Postman**, **Atom**, **WhatsApp**, **Slack**, etc. List is huge.

To create such stunning desktop apps, you just need to know HTML, CSS and **JavaScript**. That's it! You can use your favourite CSS framework or JS library to create **cross-platform**(code once, export for all) desktop apps.


## Why should we create Desktop App instead of website?

Desktop App is used because it can trigger notifications to user, set alarms, etc. By creating desktop app, users can save their data to their local machine, which eliminates the risk of clearing localstorage of browsers.
